# Cloning the Repository for Coding anfd Testing in VS Code IDE

## Preparation
### Create a new folder
I named my folder "example_folder" for this tutorial.

## Step 1 
### Go to the main branch of the GitHub repository.
![GitHub page](https://github.com/bjgill33/6th-Street-Pizza/blob/gill-working_branch/Group_6-Documentation/images_for_cloning_repo/GitHub_copy_url.png)
1. Click the green [<> Code] Icon.
2. Under the HTTPS tab, copy the URL path.

## Step 2
### Open VS Code 
**NOTE:** NO Folders should be open.

1. Click the "Clone Git Repository"
2. You will be prompted to provide a repo URL. Paste the URL you copied in Step 1.

## Step 3
### Select folder to save the cloned repository  
1. Click the "Select as Repository Destination" button.

2. You should be asked if you trust the author. Click "Yes, I trust the authors."

3. You should now see the Cloned repo being downloaded in the lower right-hand corner.

4. Now open the folder containing the cloned repo in VS Code.

5. You should now have successfully clone the repo and have it open in VS Code.

6. You are now able to select files in the folder to code and make changes **Note:** **NEVER merge your changes to the main branch unless peer reviewed**.

## Step 4
### Testing
1. The landing page is named **index.html**, this is a great place to start testing.
2. With the selected file open, click **Run > Start Debugging**

3. Select the Debugger to use. **Web App (Chrome)** is my go-to.

4. A window should open and you should see the landing page.  Testers can now begin testing the functionality of the web page and its linked pages.

5. It is ***highly recommended*** that the **CODEIUM** extention should be downloaded and installed for VS Code.  It is a great A.I. copilot that can assist in coding, testing, and documentation.
