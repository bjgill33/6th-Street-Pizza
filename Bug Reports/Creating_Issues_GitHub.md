## Steps to Report a Bug

### 1. Navigate to the Repository
- Go to the GitHub repository where you found the bug.
- Click on the **"Issues"** tab at the top of the repo.

### 2. Check for Existing Issues
- Before creating a new issue, search existing issues to see if the bug has already been reported.
- If a similar issue exists, consider adding a comment instead of opening a duplicate issue.

### 5. Provide a Clear Title
- Your title should be concise and descriptive.

  ❌ **Example:** _"Login broken"_

### 6. Write a Detailed Bug Description
A good bug report should include the following details:

#### a. Describe the Bug
- Explain what happened and what you expected to happen.

#### b. Steps to Reproduce
- Provide a step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue.
- **Example:**
  - Go to the login page on a mobile device.
  - Enter valid credentials.
  - Click the "Login" button.
  - Nothing happens (expected: user is redirected to the dashboard).
 

#### c. Screenshots (If Applicable)
- Attach screenshots or screen recordings if they help illustrate the issue.

#### d. Environment Details
- Include relevant environment details:
- **Example:**
  - **OS:** Windows 10 / macOS Ventura / Ubuntu 22.04
  - **Browser:** Chrome 120.0, Firefox 98.2
  - **Device:** iPhone 13 / Samsung Galaxy S22
  - **Version:** App v2.3.1


#### e. Possible Related Logs
- If an error message appears, include it.
- For JavaScript/browser-based issues, check the **Developer Console (F12 → Console Tab)** and paste any relevant error logs.

#### f. Additional Context (Optional)
- If you have any suggestions or related findings, mention them.

### 7. Submit the Issue
- Click **"Submit new issue"** and your report will be available for maintainers and contributors to review.

## Best Practices for Bug Reporting
✅ **Be specific and clear** – The more precise the report, the easier it is to fix.  
✅ **Provide reproduction steps** – If developers can't reproduce the bug, they can't fix it.  
✅ **Use a professional tone** – Be respectful when reporting issues.  
✅ **Follow project guidelines** – Some repositories have issue templates or specific requirements.  

### Conclusion: 
- By following these steps, your bug report will be more helpful and likely to get resolved quickly.
