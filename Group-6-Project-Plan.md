### Project Goals
The Teams goal is to provide a quick and effortless way for customers in Raleigh to order their favorite pizza. Customers will have the option to create a user account or place an order as a guest. We aim to make the ordering process as user-friendly as possible, with intuitive features like a simple click-to-select interface and an accessible shopping cart. Customers can easily review their orders, remove unwanted items, and proceed to payment seamlessly.

### Project Objectives
1. **Enable online ordering functionality** for customers to browse the menu, customize orders, and complete secure payments.
2. **Implement a user-friendly interface** that ensures user satisfaction based on usability testing and feedback.

### Project Scope
#### Included in Scope:
- Development of a web application for customers (users) to order pizza online to be ready asap or set a pick-up time based on store hours.
- Implement an account creation and authentication for customers (users).
- Secure payment processing using encryption for credit/debit card transactions.

#### Excluded from Scope:
- Integration with third-party delivery services (the project focuses only on takeout orders).
- Order tracking system 
- Inventory management system integration.
- Employee scheduling and management.

### Project Assumptions
It is assumed that all teams member are knowledgeable in intermediate levels of Python, MySQL (or any SQL), HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  It is also assumed that all team members will become familiar with AWS, Flask, Django, and Bootstrap.  If team members have any concerns or issues, they can partner with fellow members for clarification and tutelage.

### Project Constraints
1. **Time Constraints:** The project must be completed within a fixed timeline to meet the restaurant's launch deadline. Delays in development sprints could impact the delivery of key features, such as real-time order tracking or payment integration.
2. **Resource Constraints:** The development team has a limited number of developers, designers, and testers, which could slow down progress if additional features or changes are requested. Limited availability of skilled personnel for specific technologies.
3. **Technology Constraints:** The system must integrate with existing third-party services (e.g., payment gateways), which may have limitations or require custom implementation. The application must be compatible with modern web browsers and mobile devices, which may require additional testing and optimization.
4. **User Constraints:** The system must be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of customers, including those with limited technical skills. The application must support high traffic during peak hours (e.g., weekends, holidays), which could strain server resources.
5. **Scope Constraints:** The project scope is fixed, and any additional features (e.g., loyalty program, AI recommendations) must be deferred to future phases to avoid delays. Changes to requirements during development could impact the timeline.
6. **Environmental Constraints:** The system must be hosted on a reliable cloud platform with high availability (e.g., AWS, Azure). Any outages or performance issues with the cloud provider could impact the application. The development team must work within the constraints of the chosen cloud platform (e.g., storage limits, bandwidth).
7. **Quality Constraints:** The system must undergo rigorous testing to ensure it is bug-free and performs well under load. Limited testing resources could impact the quality of the final product. The application must meet high standards for security, especially for handling sensitive customer and payment data.
#### Known Dependencies:
1. **Third-Party APIs:** Payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for processing transactions.
2. **Development Tools:** The project depends on specific tools and frameworks. Any changes or updates to these tools could impact development. 
3. **Customer / Tester Input:** The project relies on customer feedback during testing phases to refine the user experience. Delays in obtaining feedback could impact the timeline.

### Project Resources Required
Project development will occur locally on team members' machines and all files will be merged together on GitHub for source control. Local development will take place in VSCode or PyCharm depending on the team member's preference. Project communication will occur on MS Teams channel and Wtcc email. Task management will be handled through Trello. As the teams get closer to deliverable product an AWS free tier account will be required for deployment.

### Team Collaboration and Communication
The team will collaborate using MS Teams group channel for daily communication, weekly team meetings, semi-daily stand-up meetings, and sprint review sessions. GitHub will be used for the groups source control, documentation, and bug fixes.

### Project Documentation
1. All Documentation will be in a standard Markdown format
2. All Documentation will be stored on the groups central GitHub repo using a structured folder system for easy navigation.
3. Documentation for all functional and non-functional requiremeents are included to keep the team away from Scope Creep.
4. Documentation will be updated and reviewed regularly.
5. The teams documentation will be made concise and clear by avoiding excessive technical jargon

### Project Management Plan and Methodologies
Agile principle will be used for the duration of the project. Project Management tools will include Trello, GitHub, and MS Teams. Multiple Sprints (usually 2-3 weeks in duration) will begin with a Sprint Planning meeting to assign roles for the sprint and end with a Sprint Review session to discuss what was successful and any opportunities for improvement if challenges arise. By using Agile methodologies our team will ensure efficient project tracking, continuous feedback, and a high quality deliverable. Agile will allow us to respond to changes quickly and ensure a successful project.
