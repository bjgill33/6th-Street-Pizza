### Problems/Challenges/Roadblocks (specify “resolved/not resolved” status):
1. Testers were not aware that testing can be done before the code is completed.
   + **STATUS**: *resolved*, Testers are now aware that testing can be used for incomplete code.  Testing on incomplete code can help the group identify what needs attention before moving on to another task.  A tutorial on logging issues (bug reports) in GitHub will be created.
2. Not all group members where available for group meetings.
   + **STATUS**: *resolved*, Availability of team members has been updated.  Team members are aware that they can reach the PM through the MS Teams app at anytime for clarification, task assignments, and other issues.  Teams members are aware that they can collaborate together when it is best suited for their availability.  Team members have been instructed to reach out to fellow members if they need help or would like to offer help.  **ALL TEAM MEMBERS have been instructed to send a quick chat message to the PM about what tasks they are working on for the current Sprint if they cannot be available for Team meetings**  
3. Some members addressed concerns about the Trello workboard.  The team felt lost because they could not see who was working on tasks in the Sprint Backlog.
   + **STATUS**: *resolved*, I've addressed this by having the team inspect the tasks on Trello and send me notification about which task they are working on or would like to complete.  I, as the PM, will assign the Sprint tasks accordingly.
